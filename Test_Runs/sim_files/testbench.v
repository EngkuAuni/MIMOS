 Here is a simple Verilog testbench for the given counter module. This testbench will check the functionality of the counter by testing various scenarios:

```verilog
module counter_tb;
  reg clk, rst, up_down, enable;
  wire [3:0] count_in, count_out;

  counter uut ( // uut stands for "unit under test"
    .clk(clk),
    .rst(rst),
    .up_down(up_down),
    .enable(enable),
    .count_in(count_in),
    .count_out(count_out)
  );

  // Instantiate a DFF for testing clock edge detection
  reg dff_data, dff_clk, dff_rst;
  always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (!dff_rst) begin
      dff_data <= count_in;
    end
  end

  // Initialization
  initial begin
    clk = 0;
    rst = 1;
    up_down = 0;
    enable = 0;
    #5 rst = 0; // assert reset for 5 time units
    #10 enable = 1; // enable counting after 10 time units
    foreach(i in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) begin
      #10 up_down = 1'b1; // increment for 10 time units
      #10 up_down = 1'b0; // decrement for 10 time units
    end
    #20 up_down = 1'bx; // allow free-running for 20 time units (X means don't care)
    #50 $finish; // halt simulation after 50 time units
  end

  initial begin
    fork
      #5 clk = ~clk; // toggle clock every 5 time units for testing edge sensitivity
      join_none
    end

endmodule
```

This testbench will verify the counter's behavior in various scenarios, including resetting, incrementing, decrementing, and free-running. It also checks the edge sensitivity of the counter by toggling the clock periodically.
